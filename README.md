## setImmediate API shim demo

This is the source code of the [setImmediate API shim demo](http://jphpsf.github.com/setImmediate-shim-demo/).

The goal of the demo is to demonstrate the setImmediate API and the usage of the setImmediate.js cross browser shim. For more info on the shim see the [setImmediate.js project on GitHub](https://github.com/NobleJS/setImmediate).

The demo was originally created by [Jason Weber](http://www.jasonweber.com) as part of the [IE Test Drive demos](https://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/setImmediateSorting/Default.html).
